# The Unofficial Asana Chrome Plugin

This is a free, open-source Chrome extension to allow quick and easy access 
to Asana. This extension uses Asana API to communicate to Asana.

This extension is based on Asana's - Official Chrome Extension available here:
[Chromestore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asana-extension-for-chrom/khnpeclbnipcdacdkhejifenadikeghk)
and [Github source](https://github.com/Asana/Chrome-Extension-Example)


## License
MIT

## Motivation
Asana's Official Chrome Extension hasn't seen any new features in years.
But they have kept their plugin under MIT license and Asana offers rich set 
of REST API. Onus is on us to develop something great out of it.
